# To-Do-App

## 🧠 How it Works

- User types a task in the input field and clicks the **"Add"** button.
- The task is displayed in a list with a **"Remove"** button.
- Clicking the **"Remove"** button deletes that specific task.
- The **sun icon** toggles between light and dark modes, and the UI adjusts accordingly.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The app is fully responsive and works perfectly across different screen sizes. Mobile-friendly with adaptive typography and layout.
